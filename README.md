# Machine-Learning-Assignment-2
Assignment 2 in IE00618: Diabetes Classification  

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the analysis of the Ames Housing dataset to predict house sale prices. We leverage statistical analysis, data visualization, and machine learning to identify significant predictors of house prices and implement regression models to estimate these prices.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need Python and several libraries related to data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning. Below are the steps to set up your environment:

### Requirements

- Python 3.8 or above
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ADNTNU/Machine-Learning-Assignment-2.git
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. **Install the required packages:**

   We recommend setting up a virtual enviroment to manage the dependencies:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
